This is a web application made with Flask, object detection based on Yolov V7 (https://github.com/WongKinYiu/yolov7/) which allows you to sort plastics.
The model was trained using the open source TACO dataset (https://github.com/pedropro/TACO)

To work, the app just needs the requirements.txt from the YoloV7 repo and a yolo .pt template in the root.
